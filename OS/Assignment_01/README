to compile: gcc -o start assignment01_Jones_Dax_readInFile.c assignment01_Jones_Dax_mainFile.c assignment01_Jones_Dax_serverFile.c -lrt

Instructions are stated on runtime, works best when selecting lower numbers in both customer count and items count

Bugs: when index 0 (or the first item) is selected, there's a bug where it'll override items after it and print the first item multiple times. This has a small chance of happening, but if it does, please rerun the program.
